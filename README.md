# Scraper

This repository is a tool for scraping data from PDF invoices. Unfortunately
the samples contain too much personal information so samples can not be added to
the repository.

## To Install Required packages

scraperwiki is required. To install:

        python3 -m pip install scraperwiki

## Todo

- scraperwiki needs to be replaced with something sensible. It has not updated
  since 2015 and doesn't properly work with Python3
